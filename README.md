About 

Biaxial Testing Platform is designed to study the material properties hyperelastic materials under complicated loading conditions. It empowers users to use Raspberry Pi 5 to precise control displacement speed and distance to collect data on the variation of force with displacement. 

Key Features: 
Frame: 1x1x0.1m 
Linear guideway: Diameter 12mm, Displacement Per Revolution 4mm, Range 0-200mm 
Force sensor: 0-200N 
Control system: Raspberry Pi 5 

Why Choose Biaxial Testing Platform?
Provide precise speed and displacement motion while handling multithreading tasks: motion control of four linear guideways and data collection from two force sensors. 
Relatively low cost compared to the original platform.
